# what we did

So, the idea of the project - extract vocals from one song, acompaniment from another - and merge them. Maybe tnue pitches and align beatrates later.
The core of the project - pretrained Spleeter model by company Deezer. Everything else was written using Librosa, which is a powerful tool for 
audio manimulations.
